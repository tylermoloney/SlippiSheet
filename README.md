## Development
This project uses Yarn as its package manager.

```yarn install``` - Install dependencies
```yarn start``` - Start the application

payload-sample.json contains an example payload. To change the user that is being queried, replace ```<ABCD#123>``` in the payload-sample.json with your own connect code and rename file to payload.json

You will also need a credentials.json file from Google for this app to be able to read and write to your Google Sheet.
